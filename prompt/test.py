text = "1. Game Overview: At 04:06 game time, our situation is as follows: We have 27 workers, 65 minerals, and 468 gas. Our supply cap is at 46 with 7 supply left, and our army supply is 8. We have two bases and a decent number of buildings and units.\n\n2. Current Game Stage: Based on the game time and resource availability, we are still in the early game stage.\n\n3. Our Situation:\n   3.1 Units and Buildings: We have a moderate number of buildings, including 2 pylons, 4 gateways, 1 cybernetics core, and 1 robotics facility. Our army consists of 3 Zealots. We have 1 worker planned for construction.\n   3.2 Economy: Our economy is still developing, with limited resources. We need to focus on expanding our worker count and gathering more minerals and gas.\n   3.3 Technology: We have a cybernetics core and a robotics facility, but there is no evidence of any advanced units or technologies being developed. We should prioritize researching and unlocking higher technologies to strengthen our army.\n\n4. Our Strategy: Currently, our strategy seems to be focused on early game expansion and defense. We need to transition into a more aggressive strategy by developing advanced units and technologies.\n\n5. Enemy's Strategy: The enemy has built an extractor, hatchery, and spawning pool. This suggests a standard Zerg opening, focusing on economy and early unit production.\n\n6. Key Information: The most crucial aspect at this moment is our limited technology and unit diversity. To counter the enemy's strategy and gain an advantage, we need to prioritize researching higher technologies and expanding our unit composition.\n\nSuggestions:\n\n1. Our Strategy: Transition into a more aggressive strategy by focusing on advanced unit production and technology research. Consider harassment tactics and map control to disrupt the enemy's economy.\n\n2. Units and Buildings: Increase the number of workers to boost our resource gathering. Expand our building infrastructure by constructing additional gateways and robotics facilities. This will allow for faster unit production and technology research.\n\n3. Economy: Prioritize resource gathering by assigning more workers to mineral and gas harvesting. Consider expanding to additional bases to increase our income and support our unit production.\n\n4. Technology: Research higher technologies to unlock advanced units and upgrades. Prioritize researching Warpgate technology to enable faster unit production. Consider researching upgrades for Zealots or unlocking new unit types like Stalkers or Immortals.\n\nDecisions:\n0: <TRAIN PROBE>\n1: <BUILD GATEWAY>\n2: <BUILD GATEWAY>\n3: <BUILD ROBOTICSFACILITY>\n4: <RESEARCH WARPGATERESEARCH>"
